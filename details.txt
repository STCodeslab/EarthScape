ðŸ’¡ One-liner for presentation:
"Isolation Forest is a machine learning algorithm that automatically detects outliers by isolating data points; anomalies get separated quickly because they differ from the majority."



. How to Present It Simply

"This endpoint takes the latest values from a dataset, computes an anomaly score using the trained Isolation Forest model, and identifies whether each point is an anomaly. If the score is low enough (like row 29 in our example), it triggers an alert. Otherwise, the system considers the point normal."



2. /forecast/train Endpoint

1. What is ARIMA?

ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. Itâ€™s a statistical model used for time-series forecasting, i.e., predicting future values based on past trends.

Purpose: Train an ARIMA model on a dataset for forecasting.


ARIMA predicts future values based on past trends and seasonality.

p,d,q:

p: autoregressive order (past values)

d: differencing order (trend)

q: moving average order (past errors)

4. How to Explain to Faculty

"We built a forecasting system using ARIMA. Users can train a model on a time-series dataset, which automatically finds the best parameters for prediction. Once trained, the system predicts future values for a defined horizon and checks these predictions against alert thresholds. Any forecasted anomaly triggers an alert, helping users monitor trends proactively."


"We trained an ARIMA model on Dubai's 2024 temperature dataset. The model predicts daily temperatures up to 24 steps ahead. The forecasts show the expected value (yhat) and a confidence range. Our ARIMA order (0,0,2) means it doesnâ€™t rely on past temperatures directly but corrects predictions based on the last 2 errors. The model successfully captured the stable temperature pattern over the forecast horizon."



/correlation/autocorr â€” Autocorrelation Function (ACF)

Purpose:

Measures how a time series is correlated with its own past values.

Useful for detecting seasonality or repeated patterns.
"Autocorrelation checks if past values influence future values. For example, temperature today might be similar to yesterdayâ€™s, showing high correlation at lag 1."

/correlation/cross â€” Cross-Correlation

Purpose:

Measures correlation between two different fields, possibly from two datasets.

Useful to see if two variables move together (positive correlation) or inversely (negative correlation).

"A correlation of -0.72 means as temperature rises, humidity tends to decrease.

"This matrix shows correlations between all selected fields. The diagonal is always 1 (a variable with itself), positive values mean variables increase together, negative means inverse relationship."

How to Explain to Faculty

Autocorrelation: Checks if a variable depends on its past values.

Cross-correlation: Measures how two variables move together or inversely.

Correlation matrix: Gives a full view of relationships between multiple variables at once.


This module provides a real-time streaming system for your datasets using Server-Sent Events (SSE). It allows clients (users or admins) to see updates as they happen in MongoDB, such as new datasets being uploaded or existing datasets being modified.
